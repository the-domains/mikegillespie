# Finally on The Grid

After literally over a year past the expected delivery date, I'm finally writing on [The Grid][0] in their Beta round as a founding member. Doing my damnedest to read both side to the user feedback and judge for myself. 

Means this little pocket of the web is likely for me to write, crosspost, and humblebrag 'til my heart's content; doing everything I can consistently think to do to push this platform to it's limits.

So buckle up!
